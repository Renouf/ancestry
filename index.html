            <h3>Origins of the surname Renouf</h3>
            <p>From <a href="http://renouf.freewebhost.co.nz/Renoufs%20of%20Guernsey%20-%20The%20Normandy%20Connection.pdf">Renoufs of Guernsey - The Normandy Connection</a> written by Jacky Renouf...</p>
            <p>The origins of the name Renouf, or its variants, Renou, Renoul, Renoux, provide us with a starting point. The name is said to have been given to a single Germanic man “raginwulf” [wolf +consul/adviser] and then came into wider usage as a forename. By 1000 A.D. it began to be used as a surname. Today, people with these names live primarily in the western reaches of France, and as far as Renouf is concerned, primarily in the Caen area of Normandy and on its Cotentin Peninsula, with approximately 2500 people with the Renouf surname residing in Normandy at the beginning of the 21st century.</p>
